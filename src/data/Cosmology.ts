    relationshipToReality:
      "Guardians of cosmic systems and meta-level concepts.",
    contractability:
      "A contract with an Angel is a petition for them to apply their function of guardianship. A summoner can request an Angel to intensify its protection over a specific person, place, or principle. The 'cost' is typically a vow or action that aligns with the cosmic law the Angel guards. They don't bend their nature; they focus it.",

    origin:
      "Born in the barren fields of reality where divinity's light does not reach (the null, the autonomous gap).",
    function:
      "Act as unobliged, autonomous agents with free will outside of divine control. They can teach, bargain, or refuse interaction.",
    relationshipToReality:
      "Represent autonomous phenomena. Their freedom lies in their ability to bind themselves by their own word.",
    contractability:
      "Demons are the most literal contractors. In their default state, they are completely free. Once a deal is struck, they transition to a 'Contracted State' where they are absolutely bound to the literal terms of the agreement. Their only remaining freedom is in the interpretation of those terms, making 'monkey paw' scenarios a significant risk.",

  DivineBorn: {
    origin:
      "Divine in origin (e.g., born from solar flares, first dead souls, mortal ascension), but autonomous in nature.",
    function:
      "Serve specific, bound cosmic roles. They are free agents with divine power but are tied to their function (e.g., a cosmic smith MUST forge, an underworld ruler MUST manage the dead).",
    relationshipToReality: "Specialized, role-bound divine functions.",
    contractability:
      "A contract with a Divine Born is a commission for them to perform their specific, unchangeable function for the summoner's benefit. One might contract 'the ancestral spark' to forge an item or 'the green queen' to create a forest. They do not change their role; they simply perform it on request for a price that aligns with their domain.",

  Fey: {
    cosmicName: "hohoãheé",
    origin: "Born from the manipulation of rules by various beings.",
    function:
      "Carry the will of the rules they are bound to. Invoking a Fey in a spell allows the caster to modify the rule that Fey embodies.",
    relationshipToReality: "Living embodiments of transformable cosmic rules.",
    contractability:
      "Contracting a Fey is an 'Invocation'. In their default state, they enforce a cosmic rule rigidly. When invoked, they enter a temporary 'Invoked State' where that rule becomes malleable, allowing the summoner to bend, rewrite, or ignore the rule for the duration of the spell. This is the only way to lawfully alter cosmic principles.",

    cosmicName: "hahéèhùé",
    origin: "Born from divinity's refusal to intervene directly.",
    function:
      "Carry the most straightforward, individual cosmic aspects and forces through the physical realm. They are the direct embodiment of a single concept.",
    relationshipToReality:
      "The simplest, most direct manifestation of a cosmic concept (e.g., a Fire Elemental IS fire). They carry the individual concepts that Angels guard at a systemic level.",
    contractability:
      "A contract with an Elemental is a summoning ritual. They don't negotiate terms, but can be compelled to manifest their essence if the summoner provides the correct conditions and price. One contracts a Fire Elemental for a great blaze or a Titanium Elemental to create a barrier. The contract is the act of creation itself.",

    relationshipToReality:
      "Embodiments of experiential and archetypal aspects of reality.",
    contractability:
      "A contract with a Conjurate is an invocation of their archetype. One makes a deal with 'The Emperor' to bring structure to a chaotic nation or 'The Star' to find lost hope. The contract is an exchange to have that specific archetypal energy influence reality on the summoner's behalf.",
